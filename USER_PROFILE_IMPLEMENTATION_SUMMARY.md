# User Profile System Implementation Summary

## Problem Resolved
✅ **FIXED**: User profile dropdown actions were not working - clicking on "My Profile", "Account Settings", "Notifications", etc. did nothing because the routes didn't exist.

## Solution Implemented
Created a complete user profile system with all required functionality:

### 1. Backend Routes (`routes/user_profile.py`)
- **Profile Management**: View and edit user profile information
- **Password Changes**: Secure password update functionality  
- **Notifications**: User notification management system
- **Alerts**: System alerts and status updates
- **Help & Support**: FAQ system and support information
- **About Page**: Application information and technology stack
- **Account Settings**: Account preferences and settings

### 2. Frontend Templates
- `user_profile.html` - Main profile editing interface
- `notifications.html` - Notification management with filtering
- `alerts.html` - System alerts with severity levels
- `help_support.html` - FAQ and support documentation
- `about.html` - Application information display
- `account_settings.html` - Account settings interface

### 3. Integration Updates
- `app.py` - Added user_profile_bp blueprint registration
- All templates use consistent glass-morphism styling
- Responsive design with Bootstrap 5
- Proper error handling and flash messages
